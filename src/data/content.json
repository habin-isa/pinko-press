In 2018 a fragment of the building, salvaged from the ongoing demolition, was shipped to Venice to be displayed at the 2018 iteration of the Biennale. \r\nConsidered by some as a crime ridden eyesore and by others to be one of the twentieth century\u2019s most important buildings, Robin Hood Gardens has long been a key battle ground in the ever-expanding gentrification of London. The campaign against its demolition, spearheaded by The Twentieth Century Society, was championed by the likes of Richard Rogers and Zaha Hadid, with Hadid stating that \"The importance of Robin Hood Gardens as a formative project in the history of architecture cannot be under-estimated.\"   However these campaigns always felt facile, focusing too much on the building as architectural history.

By that time however, the communities living there had been moved on and the estate felt like an empty monument to a long dead idea.  When it was announced a fragment of the building would be displayed at the Venice Bienale, the idea of Robin Hood Gardens the building of architectural importance, irrespective of its function as social housing, had come full circle. \r\n      In a series of essays images, and reflections this website explores how the demolition and subsequent display of Robin Hood Gardens came about, asking what this process might mean for the future of housing in London. In doing so, we ask what role we might play in the fight against the rapidly increasing gentrification of our cities. \r\n      This website will updated intermittently with new pieces of writing available as downloadable PDFs and aims to act as a living archive, updating as the issues evolve."
